Day 4: 30 Days of JavaScript - Looping Through the Possibilities!

This week, we've conquered variables, data types, operators, and control structures. Today, we delve into loops â€“ the workhorses that allow us to repeat code blocks efficiently!

Loops are control structures that execute a block of code repeatedly until a specific condition is met.  JavaScript offers three primary loop types:

for loop: Used for iterating a set number of times. We define a starting point, condition, and increment/decrement to control the loop's execution.

JavaScript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
}
Use code with caution.

while loop: Continues executing the code as long as a specified condition remains true.

JavaScript
let count = 0;
while (count < 3) {
  console.log("Counting:", count);
  count++;
}
Use code with caution.

do-while loop: Similar to a while loop, but it guarantees at least one execution of the code block before checking the condition.

JavaScript
let count = 0;
do {
  console.log("Counting (at least once):", count);
  count++;
} while (count < 3);
Use code with caution.

Loops are essential for tasks like iterating through arrays, performing calculations a set number of times, or continuously checking for user input.
